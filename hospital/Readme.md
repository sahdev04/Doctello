- I have used Azure Bot Service to create the chatbot.
- The chatbot is mainly used to find your diabetic condition according to your Bmi , allowing patient to get quick response.
- It is based on your bmi so this information may be true.

- It does not give accurate data.
- The chatbot is deployed using Azure App Service.
